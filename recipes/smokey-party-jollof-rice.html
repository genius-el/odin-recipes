        <h2>How to prepare smokey party jollof rice</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Smokey party jollof rice is not just of the normal party jollof rice. It has a smokey aroma that gives it a more savoury taste. 
            It is a Nigerian meal prepared and eaten in most Nigerian events and households. Some rate it as the best kind there is.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups basmati rice</li>
            <li>Blended Pepper, tatashe, onions and tomato mix</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon powdered white pepper</li>
            <li>Well seasoned meat stock</li>
            <li>big leaf of bay leaf</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (to fry tomato mix)</li>
            <li>gram butter</li>
            <li>Seasoning</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 medium Diced onions
            <li>Diced cooked and fried cow liver (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The best of non soggy jollof rice starts from the tomato mix. This should be boiled until completely dried but not burnt.
                This takes away every sharp taste from the tomato and removes excess water that contributes to sogginess.</li>
            <li>When the tomato mix is completely dried, set aside and place a clean pot on the fire</li>
            <li>Pour in the vegetable oil and allow to heat up. Add the tomato mix and fry very well until the mix starts clumping in tiny bits.</li>
            <li>Add the bayleaf and pour in the meatstock and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Also note that delicious meatstock is priority if you need a tasty jollof rice (ginger and garlic should be used).</li>
            <li>Cover this to cook for a while (like 4minutes)</li>
            <li>Then pour in your rinsed rice and stir fast before it starts to boil.</li>
            <li>Add water just to thesame level of the rice (basmati rice softens fast and can get all messy fast). So be sure not to
                put too much water.</li>
            <li>Taste for seasoning and adjust with the seasoning and salt if needed.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to very low and cover the pot with foil paper to trap in the heat.</li>
            <li>Then cover with the lid.</li>
            <li>Check after 20-25minutes if the stock has almost dried off and then pour in some diced or sliced onions and cover again.</li>
            <li>After 3minutes, open and stir the rice to mix. Even if the rice is still a bit hard, do not add more water. Just cover again and continue cooking with low heat. The heat is what would finish off the cooking.</li>
            <li>Keep an eye and stir after 15minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and liver and cover for 3minutes. Then stir and cook for 1 more minute.</li>

        </ol>
