        <h2><em>How to prepare spaghetti and meatballs</em></h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Spaghetti and Meatballs is an Italian – American dish which typically consists of Mincemeat, 
            Tomato Sauce and Spaghetti. Spaghetti and Meatballs is absolutely delicious and very easy to whip up. 
            Now, this recipe is not a typical Italian take, but more of a Nigerian twist. 
            I personally do not like Tomato sauces as I always find them a bit sour and no matter how well they’re cooked, 
            it’s almost impossible to get rid of the acidic taste, my opinion. So, what I do is add Sweet Bell Peppers and 
            a bit of hotness (Scotch Bonnet) to the Tomatoes to balance the taste and flavour.</p>
        <p>You’ll notice the recipe calls for Breadcrumbs, now, this is important. Breadcrumbs improve the texture of the meatballs; 
            when/ where they’re added,the meatballs will be noticeably smoother and spongier.  If you have trouble sourcing Breadcrumbs, simply soak two 
            bread slices in 1/4 cup of milk until soggy, squeeze out the excess milk. Mash up the bread and combine with the 
            mincemeat, same result. In case you’re wondering, the egg in the recipe will help to bind the meatballs and keep 
            them from falling apart while cooking. Let’s cook!</p>
